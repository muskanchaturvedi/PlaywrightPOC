Playwright POC Folder Structure

Introduction to TypeScript and Playwright
TypeScript:
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, which helps catch errors early through type checking. It is particularly useful for large-scale applications and improves developer productivity.
Playwright:
Playwright is a Node.js library for automating web browsers. It supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit). It allows for end-to-end testing and can be used to perform various browser interactions like clicking, typing, and navigating.

Detailed Explanation
vscode/
This folder contains settings and configurations specific to Visual Studio Code. Customizing settings in this folder can improve the development experience within the VS Code editor.
node_modules/
This folder contains all the libraries and dependencies installed via npm (Node Package Manager). These packages are essential for running your project.
src/
The main source folder where your project's source code resides. It includes the following subfolders and files:
•	pages/ This subfolder contains TypeScript files that represent different pages of your application. Each file defines a class or functions to interact with specific pages of your website.
•	cartPage.ts: Contains code related to the cart page.
•	checkoutPage.ts: Contains code related to the checkout page.
•	homePage.ts: Contains code related to the home page.
•	productPage.ts: Contains code related to the product page.
•	utils/ This subfolder contains utility functions or helper functions that can be used across different tests or pages.
•	utility.ts: A file containing utility functions.
•	example.test.spec.ts An example test specification file, likely created as a sample or template for writing tests.
•	place_order.spec.ts Contains test scripts to place an order on the website.
•	search_product.spec.ts Contains test scripts to search for a product on the website.
•	verifyHomePage.spec.ts Contains test scripts to verify functionalities on the homepage.
test-results/
This folder usually stores the results of your test runs, such as logs, screenshots, and reports. It helps in reviewing and debugging test outcomes.
gitignore
Specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git, preventing them from being included in version control. Commonly used to exclude dependencies, build files, and sensitive information.
package-lock.json
Records the exact version of every package that was installed, ensuring that the same versions are used if the project is re-installed. Helps in maintaining consistency across different environments.
package. Json
Contains metadata about your project, such as name, version, and dependencies. It also includes scripts for running various tasks, like testing and building the project.
playwright.config.ts
A configuration file used to set up Playwright settings, such as browser options, test directories, and timeouts. It allows customization of the testing environment.
tsconfig.json
A configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies compiler options and project-specific TypeScript settings, ensuring proper compilation and type-checking.
